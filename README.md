# NIRAL'24 Frontend

This repository contains the frontend codebase for **NIRAL'24**, a national-level symposium organized by MCA students. The application is developed using **Svelte** and **Vite**, offering a responsive, interactive, and efficient user experience for participants and administrators alike.

As the technical lead, I developed a scalable backend system to support key features such as user registration, event enrollment, and real-time interactions â€” all of which integrate seamlessly with this frontend.

## Features

* Dynamic and interactive UI with Svelte
* Seamless event registration flow
* Location-aware forms using `country-state-city`
* Responsive design and animation with GSAP
* Particle effects and toast notifications
* Routing with `svelte-routing`
