Participants must demonstrate their understanding of various data structures by accurately identifying the best fit for each scenario. The challenge must be completed within a strict time limit of 15 minutes. This round is designed to assess the participants' foundational knowledge and quick decision-making abilities. Only the top 6 participants who perform best in terms of accuracy and speed will advance to the next round."

    "desc": "The second round is an intensive coding challenge divided into four sets of questions, with each set allocated a time span of 25 minutes. Participants will be required to write code to solve the given problems, focusing heavily on both time and space complexity. The evaluation criteria will emphasize the efficiency of the solutions, ensuring that participants not only solve the problems but do so in the most optimal manner possible. Rankings will be assigned based on the efficiency of the code for each question, and these rankings will be updated concurrently as each set is completed. The participant who consistently performs at the highest level and holds the top rank after the final question will be declared the winner."
