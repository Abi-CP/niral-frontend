        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-bolt"></i> Round 1: Decoding the Killer's Calling Card </h3> 
        <p> (Focus: Data Exploration & Filtering) The investigation begins with examining the digital footprint of the victims.</p>
        <p>Databases will provide details about their social media activity, financial records, and any other relevant information. Your task, as cyber detectives, will be to utilise SQL queries to sift through this data. </p>
        <p>By analysing their recent posts, messages, and location check-ins, you'll be searching for patterns that connect the victims. This might involve uncovering shared social circles, or past conflicts.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, you'll be on the lookout for the cryptic symbol, hoping to find instances of it happening again. This initial phase is crucial to understanding the killer's motives and identifying potential links between the victims. </p>

        <p>(Focus: Advanced SQL & Data Analysis): 
          The clock is ticking. With a suspect in mind, we need to leverage advanced SQL techniques. </p>
        <p>Craft complex queries using subqueries, joins, and functions like COUNT, SUM, and GROUP BY.</p>
        <p>This will expose connections between the suspect and the victims. The success of this round hinges on combining all the data to predict the next target's location. By acting swiftly, we can use SQL to apprehend the killer before they strike again.

    "desc": " In this preliminary round, participants will be presented with 10 distinct questions, each requiring the selection of an appropriate data structure to solve a specific problem. Participants must demonstrate their understanding of various data structures by accurately identifying the best fit for each scenario. The challenge must be completed within a strict time limit of 15 minutes. This round is designed to assess the participants' foundational knowledge and quick decision-making abilities. Only the top 6 participants who perform best in terms of accuracy and speed will advance to the next round."

    "round": "Round 2: Coding Efficiency Challenge",
    "desc": "The second round is an intensive coding challenge divided into four sets of questions, with each set allocated a time span of 25 minutes. Participants will be required to write code to solve the given problems, focusing heavily on both time and space complexity. The evaluation criteria will emphasize the efficiency of the solutions, ensuring that participants not only solve the problems but do so in the most optimal manner possible. Rankings will be assigned based on the efficiency of the code for each question, and these rankings will be updated concurrently as each set is completed. The participant who consistently performs at the highest level and holds the top rank after the final question will be declared the winner."
