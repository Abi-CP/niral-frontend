        <p>Skilled teams for the mission are to be recruited by the Forest Rangers. The recruited team is entrusted with the mission to retrieve the vital research Dr. Nova left behind. This mission could be a one-way trip, as the last known location of her research station is surrounded by a treacherous, uncharted wilderness.</p>
        <p>Only Dr. Nova had the knowledge to navigate a safe return. Since previous teams have failed to return, the mission has two objectives: to decode the way back and to retrieve Dr. Nova's research.</p>
        <p>Time is critical, as the oxygen supply embedded in the team's gear lasts only a few minutes in the dense, toxic forest. If the first objective is met, the team will survive. But if both are achieved, the team will be hailed as the saviours of humanity! The hope of our species' survival rests on the success of this mission...

    "desc": " In this preliminary round, participants will be presented with 10 distinct questions, each requiring the selection of an appropriate data structure to solve a specific problem. Participants must demonstrate their understanding of various data structures by accurately identifying the best fit for each scenario. The challenge must be completed within a strict time limit of 15 minutes. This round is designed to assess the participants' foundational knowledge and quick decision-making abilities. Only the top 6 participants who perform best in terms of accuracy and speed will advance to the next round."

    "round": "Round 2: Coding Efficiency Challenge",
    "desc": "The second round is an intensive coding challenge divided into four sets of questions, with each set allocated a time span of 25 minutes. Participants will be required to write code to solve the given problems, focusing heavily on both time and space complexity. The evaluation criteria will emphasize the efficiency of the solutions, ensuring that participants not only solve the problems but do so in the most optimal manner possible. Rankings will be assigned based on the efficiency of the code for each question, and these rankings will be updated concurrently as each set is completed. The participant who consistently performs at the highest level and holds the top rank after the final question will be declared the winner."
